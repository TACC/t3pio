This software (T3PIO) is a parallel library to improve the parallel performance of
MPI I/O. Since Parallel HDF5 uses MPI I/O, this library will improve the performance
of it as well.  This library interacts with the Lustre filesystem to match the
application to the filesystem.

The parallel I/O performance depends on three parameters:

    1) Number of writers
    2) Number of stripes
    3) Stripe size

This library focuses on writing of files. When an application creates a file, it is
the only time that one can control the number of stripes.  This library extracts data
from the lustre file system to set all three parameters to improve performance.




The use of the library is straight-forward. In Fortran, it looks like this:

   subroutine hdf5_writer(....)
   use hdf5
   use t3pio
   integer globalSize          ! Estimate of GlobalSize of file in (MB)
   integer info                ! MPI Info object
   integer comm                ! MPI Communicator
   integer(hid_t) :: plist_id  ! Property list identifier
   ...

   comm = MPI_COMM_WORLD

   ! Initialize info object.
   call MPI_Info_create(info, ierr)

   ! use library to fill info with nwriters, stripe
   call t3pio_set_info(comm, info, "./", ierr,   &         ! <--- T3PIO library call
                       GLOBAL_SIZE=globalSize)}
   call H5open_f(ierr)
   call H5Pcreate_f(H5P_FILE_ACCESS_F,plist_id},ierr)
   call H5Pset_fapl_mpio_f(plist_id, comm, info, ierr)
   call H5Fcreate_f(fileName, H5F_ACC_TRUNC_F, file_id, ierr,
                    access_prp = plist_id})


Essentially, you make the normal calls to create an HDF5 file.  The only addition is
to call "t3pio_set_info" with the communicator, an info object, the directory where the file
is to be written.  Optionally, you can specify an estimate of the global size of the file.
