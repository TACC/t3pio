This software (T3PIO) is a parallel library to improve the parallel performance of
MPI I/O. Since Parallel HDF5 uses MPI I/O, this library will improve the performance
of it as well.  This library interacts with the Lustre filesystem to match the
application to the filesystem.

The parallel I/O performance depends on three parameters:

    1) Number of writers
    2) Number of stripes
    3) Stripe size

This library focuses on writing of files. When an application creates a file, it is
the only time that one can control the number of stripes
